# Data Whitening ICA
This program shows how data whitening is performed for ICA algorithm preprocessing

## Code Template
This program has been written over the MATLAB file found on [ICA for Dummies](http://arnauddelorme.com/ica_for_dummies/).  
It only makes some minor changes: the signals that are processed are different, and the printing of information is modified.
